MITRE ATT&CK Technique: Logon Script (Windows) (T1037.001)

Description:
Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system.(Citation: TechNet Logon Scripts) This is done via adding a path to a script to the <code>HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript</code> Registry key.(Citation: Hexacorn Logon Scripts)

Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary. 

Detection:
Monitor for changes to Registry values associated with Windows logon scrips, nameley <code>HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript</code>.

Monitor running process for actions that could be indicative of abnormal programs or executables running upon logon.

Tactics: persistence, privilege-escalation
Required Permissions: Unknown
Effective Permissions: Unknown
