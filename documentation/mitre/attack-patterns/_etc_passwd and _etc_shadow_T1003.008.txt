MITRE ATT&CK Technique: /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow (T1003.008)

Description:
Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code> to enable offline password cracking. Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code> to store user account information including password hashes in <code>/etc/shadow</code>. By default, <code>/etc/shadow</code> is only readable by the root user.(Citation: Linux Password and Shadow File Formats)

The Linux utility, unshadow, can be used to combine the two files in a format suited for password cracking utilities such as John the Ripper:(Citation: nixCraft - John the Ripper) <code># /usr/bin/unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > /tmp/crack.password.db</code>


Detection:
The AuditD monitoring tool, which ships stock in many Linux distributions, can be used to watch for hostile processes attempting to access <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code>, alerting on the pid, process name, and arguments of such programs.

Tactics: credential-access
Required Permissions: root
Effective Permissions: Unknown
