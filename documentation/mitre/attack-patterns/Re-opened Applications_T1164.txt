MITRE ATT&CK Technique: Re-opened Applications (T1164)

Description:
Starting in Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), users can specify certain applications to be re-opened when a user reboots their machine. While this is usually done via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on an app-by-app basis, there are property list files (plist) that contain this information as well located at <code>~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist</code> and <code>~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.* .plist</code>. 

An adversary can modify one of these files directly to include a link to their malicious executable to provide a persistence mechanism each time the user reboots their machine (Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence).

Detection:
Monitoring the specific plist files associated with reopening applications can indicate when an application has registered itself to be reopened.

Tactics: persistence
Required Permissions: User
Effective Permissions: Unknown
