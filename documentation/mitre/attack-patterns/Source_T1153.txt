MITRE ATT&CK Technique: Source (T1153)

Description:
**This technique has been deprecated and should no longer be used.**

The <code>source</code> command loads functions into the current shell or executes files in the current context. This built-in command can be run in two different ways <code>source /path/to/filename [arguments]</code> or <code>.**This technique has been deprecated and should no longer be used.** /path/to/filename [arguments]</code>. Take note of the space after the ".". Without a space, a new shell is created that runs the program instead of running the program within the current context. This is often used to make certain features or functions available to a shell or to update a specific shell's environment.(Citation: Source Manual)

Adversaries can abuse this functionality to execute programs. The file executed with this technique does not need to be marked executable beforehand.

Detection:
Monitor for command shell execution of source and subsequent processes that are started as a result of being executed by a source command. Adversaries must also drop a file to disk in order to execute it with source, and these files can also detected by file monitoring.

Tactics: execution
Required Permissions: User
Effective Permissions: Unknown
